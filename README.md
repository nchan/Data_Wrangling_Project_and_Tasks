# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks

## purpose of the repository
this repo is public to host the work I did for the final project and coursework for QBS181.

I have been given permission to make my work public.

## subdirectory descriptions
subfolders beginning with 'ex'are those containing course exercises throughout the term. Not all exercises are available as my earlier versions were submitted via Word docs and screenshots. I have included the code of the .Rmd, .sql, and .R files that I could find.

subfolders beginning with 'project' refer to the homework assignments for the course - these were longer, more challenging to work on.

'midterm' subfolder includes the work I did for the course midterm. likewise the 'final' folder for the final.
